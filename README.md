## twitter.class.php (extension to codebird-php)

For getting the last _n_ tweets from a specific user's timeline.  
Requires `php5-curl` to work.  

#### Usage:

Insert your application's 'consumer key' and 'consumer secret' and send a request to the file with `user` and `count`.

E.g - `https://www.my-server.com/twitter.php?count=1&user=kdude63` will return my most recent tweet.
